> **P.S.** I'm new to Linux Devlopment this is my first project<br>

But there will be a Plasma 6 Version in devlopment in the future for all you Plasma 6 Users :3


<div>&nbsp;</div>

## IMPORANT
I couldn't figure out how to add a delay to the Splash Screen code to prevent the Desktop from loading instantly but I did figure out how to force delay the plasma 5 desktop using a startup command.

<div>&nbsp;</div>

## Install to settings

To install the Splash screen you can use:
```sh
mv ~/"PATH_TO_THE_SPLASH_SCREEN_LOCATION"/ ~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/
```
<div>&nbsp;</div>

## To setup the Desktop delay so that the whole thing plays without instantly loading the desktop

1. If you don't have a mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/ use this command to make one
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
```
 
2. type in termnial
```sh
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/splash-delay.service
```





3.Add To Nano Config
```sh
[Unit]
Description=Wait for Splash Animation
Before=plasma-workspace.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/sleep 10 #the number here is for how long to wait before loading the desktop environment the whole video is 9 seconds but I set it to 10 to be safe
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=plasma-workspace.target
```

#### 3. save the nano config (DON'T RENAME IT otherwise the command on the next step won't work.)

<div>&nbsp;</div>

4.Enable the nano config
```sh
systemctl --user enable splash-delay.service
```
<div>&nbsp;</div>

5.Restart Your PC

<div>&nbsp;</div>

#### Note

To disable the nano config type
```sh
systemctl --user disable splash-delay.service
```

## Uninstall


#### This disables the delay and uninstalls all the file related to <ins>steam-girl-splash-theme</ins>
```sh
systemctl --user disable splash-delay.service

rm -r -f ~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/steam-girl-splash-theme/ ~/.config/systemd/user/plasma-workspace.target.wants/ ~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/ ~/.config/systemd/user/splash-delay.service
```
