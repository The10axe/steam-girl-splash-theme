I couldn't figure out how to add a delay to the Splash Screen code to prevent the Desktop from loading instantly but I did figure out how to force delay the plasma 5 desktop using a startup command.



Steps to setup the delay to let the Splash play all the way through.

1. type "nano ~/.nanorc" in the termnial.

2. add the text below to the nano config.



## To setup the Desktop load delay to let the whole thing play without instantly loading the desktop

Nano Config:
'''sh
[Unit]
Description=Wait for Splash Animation
Before=plasma-workspace.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/sleep 10
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=plasma-workspace.target
'''

3. save the nano config (DON'T RENAME IT)

4. Enable the nano config

Enable the nano config:
'''sh
systemctl --user enable splash-delay.service
'''

#now when you login in again the splash will have time to play the whole thing before loading to desktop


#### Note

To disable the nano config type:
'''sh
systemctl --user disable splash-delay.service
'''

### Install to settings setup

To install the Splash screen you can use:
'''sh
mv "PATH_TO_THE_SPLASH_SCREEN" ~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/
'''
